Requirements
------------
Drupal 5


Installation
------------
1. Copy the user_relationships folder to the appropriate Drupal directory.

2. Enable User Relationships in the "Site building -> modules" administration screen.

   Enabling the User Relationships module will trigger the creation of the database schema. 
   If you are shown error messages you may have to create the schema by hand. Please 
   see the database definition at the end of this file.

3. Create relationship types in "User Management -> User Relationships -> Add relationship"


Developers
------------
I tried to make this module as modular as possible (is that a horrible sentence? I don't care).
This is the core to a more robust set of features that are built as addons. I tried to make it as
extensible as possible. If you need something more out of the core (and I hope that you don't), please
feel free to get in contact with me (http://drupal.org/user/107579/contact) and we can talk about it.

Take a look at the following files for more information about the API and theme-able functions provided
  user_relationships_api.inc
  user_relationships_theme.inc

The module also invokes a "user_relationships" hook passing in the following argumens:
  $type will be a string of the following
    'insert type'   before a new relationship type is created
    'update type'   before a relationship type is updated
    'delete type'   after a relationship type is deleted
    'load type'     after a relationship type is loaded (so you can add data to it if you'd like)

    'load'          after a relationship is loaded
    'insert'        after a new relationship is created
    'update'        before a relationship is updated
    'delete'        after a relationship is deleted

  $relationship either the relationship_type or relationship object
  
  $category a string currently only used when 'delete' is invoked
    'remove'        when a relationship is removed
    'cancel'        when a relationship request is cancelled
    'disapprove'    when a relationship request is disapprove

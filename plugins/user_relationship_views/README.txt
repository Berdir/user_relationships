      VALUE: any valid user ID

    Author is related to UID through RTID:
      show only nodes where the author has a relationship type specified by RTID
      This argument should probably be used in conjunction with "UID is related to Author" as a way of filtering by relationship type
      VALUE: any valid rtid for a relationship type

    UID to Author is (Non-)Approved:
      show only nodes where the author has an approved or non-approved relationship

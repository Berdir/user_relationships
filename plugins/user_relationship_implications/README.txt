User Relationship Implications Module
-------------------------------------
This is a plugin module for the User Relationships module.

It allows admins to set up implied relationships (ex: Manager implies Coworker).
These implies relationships will be automatically created. If a relationship that is
implied by another is deleted the implied by relationship is also deleted.

Implied relationships can be chained (ex: Manager implies Coworker implies Officemate)

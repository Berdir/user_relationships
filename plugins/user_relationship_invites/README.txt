Installation

Enable User Relationship Invites in the "Site building -> modules" administration screen.

Please note: we had to patch invite module to make this work, so you'll need to use a version of invite dated after 10/14/2007 or apply the patch yourself. The patch can be found at http://drupal.org/node/175518.
